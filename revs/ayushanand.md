"Kota Factory" as the name suggest is something that has evolved out of the city of Kota, the largest JEE/NEET Aspirants hub in India. A fun fact to tell is that this is the maiden web-series that I've watched during my entire life time. I don't even try to explore or observe the critics about other web-series of any type because more or less they all are works of pure fiction and thats where my mind inculcates hatred because I am very repulsive to any type of content in any form thats a work of fiction.

Talking a little more about my hatred for fiction, I would also like to tell some more peculiar (as called by 21st Century youth) things that I've done or I do as of now.

• I did never download Amazon Prime, Netflix, Alt Balaji etc. apps that feature web-series primarily.

• I never watch movies without reason, in fact the ones I've watched had been followed by sense of fascination in my mind that let me watch them.

Now lets come back to the 'Kota Factory'. I guess most people would have watched this web-series and who might not know Jeetu Bhaiya, the IIT-Alum who is the Messiah of JEE Aspirant for Physics. Jeetu Bhaiya (Original Name : Jitendra Kumar) is my favorite actor indeed and not just because I've admired his role play in this series, but he is indeed an eminent actor and has the potential to play diverse type of roles.

The cast indeed is a group of cheerful students among which all are of different types, by behaviour, by academic rigour, by determination, by perspectives etc. but irony is that there is still harmony among them and they've played their roles really nice. If I get a scene from Kota Factory in my dream then the next morning, I won't call it to be a web series unless I come to know that it really is a web-series 

Not expanding the content too long, I would like to put it to a closing. Overall, 'Kota Factory' can be rated on a 0 to 5 scale on its distinctive areas.

• VIDEOGRAPHY : 4.4
