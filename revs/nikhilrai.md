This is one show which I strongly recommend to people to watch. Honestly, I started watching
this show from 5th of April, this year after the latest season got released that too out of peer
pressure cuz the whole freaking world was putting stories of it n because of the hype which was
created for this show. A lot of my friends recommended it to me earlier but m not a big fan of
heist movies or shows but I made an exception with this one and since I didn’t have a Netflix
account so just for downloading this entire show of 4 seasons I got a recharge done of 101 Rs(I
know it’s huge ). When I watched the first season I was bit disappointed n I thought that it is
highly overrated, maybe it happened because I had too much expectations from it, but still I fell
in love with all the characters n then I saw season 2 n I thought that it compensated for all the
disappointments n then I saw season 3 n then back to back 4 n trust me never have I cried so
much while watching a show not even during Game of thrones or Vampire diaries. It’s said that
boys don’t cry so easily, this show is gonna break this rule for sure. I could not control myself
from falling in love with the characters specially the female ones cuz damn they are so fucking
badass. Whether it is Tokyo or Nairobo, or Alicia, or Lisbon or Stockholm. Well the secret of the
names is going to unveil once u watch the show . This show has to be one of the most
heartbreaking n most heartwarming show at the same time. I cried with the characters who are
thieves actually, I laughed with them, I celebrated their victory n I cried again in their failures. My
heart almost stopped at times n I could clearly hear my heartbeats at moments, I got bad
goosebumps n I cried my heart out. I believe they have been one of the most loved thieves ever
in the history of freaking everything. My god, I can just keep on writing bout this show. I even
fought with my friend Snigdha , the one who forced me to watch this show cuz i told her that its
not as good as she said n then later I cried with her over every moment n then she kept on
taunting me throughout. Nairobi- Man I lover so so freakin much. U will know why once you
watch it. So go for it immediately!! Tokyo aka TABAHI, She is going to drive you crazzzyyyy! N
ofcourse, maybe U’ve heard of him in memes if you know nothing bout the show. The Main Man-
The Professor, the smartest of &#39;em all!!!! This show is a great experience which I highly
recommend. N one thing I can say for sure that watching this show is gonna be a Rollercoaster
ride so u better tighten ur seat belts and hop in immediately in this show after reading this review.
We all need to be grateful to the makers of this show For the gem of a freakin show they’ve
made. I can&#39;t wait for the next season now. I hope it comes soon.�� So guys go watch it ASAP n
trust me U are not going to regret for sure.
