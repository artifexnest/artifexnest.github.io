"Nasamajh ko kya samajh gustakhi kya cheez hoti hai
Kisiko nasamajh samajhna bhi gustakhi hoti hai"
This is exactly how the lead and supporting protagonists of this show would have completed each other's sentences had they been shayar, or better, Indian. 

Although unintentionally, this show does share some very Indian roots. 
"Putraat shisyaat icchet parajayam" (sanskrit), meaning, one should always expect defeat from a disciple or their offsprings. 
The show revolves around a kingdom, wherein the throne eventually keeps on passing from one person to another. 
Initially in this matriarchy, two loyal soldiers defend the kingdom against their foes, but not for long. Greed for, not money, status eventually corrupts one of the soldier, which sends the empire down a very rough path. 
The loyal soldier and his protege face many difficult and such challenges that possess threat to the existence and the very essences of the kingdom. 

As personal life of everyone starts getting tangled, the kingdom starts loosening its grip.
To maintain the essence of their subjects the kingdom goes through many changes of hierarchy. Eventually it become a monotonous and not so one of a kind show. 

If you like watching these games of throne, please by all means check out this show called, Suits.
